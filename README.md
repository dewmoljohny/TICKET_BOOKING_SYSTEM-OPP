# TICKET_BOOKING_SYSTEM-OPP
Bus ticket booking system framed with OOP concepts in C++


**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

**Ideal situation:**
Government lifted most of the travel restrictions in several phases post Covid-19 lockdown; the second wave of Covid in Kerala has made the Government rethink on travel guidelines. In a bid to deal with the second onslaught of Coronavirus, the Government has issued new restrictions on traveling and fines for rule-breaking.
Also the private bus ticket booking system can control the transportation system via online which enhances the safety of passengers with minimum risk. This can also ensure that the passengers are up to the limit based on the restrictions given by government. Implementing this system can save time and avoid clashes between the bus drivers which is common nowadays.

**Real situation:**
During the present crisis, government takes possible measures to reduce the crowd in public to avoid the spread of pandemic disease. So now days everything goes virtually in hand through online platforms. So considering the case of private bus transportation, there is a severe need of time management and ticket booking which can improves a lot more on preventing the present spread of virus. People had to wait for a long time in bus tops during the whole day, and also proper count on passengers during this period is not checked properly. This can put the passengers in risk.


**Consequences:**
This system is based on a concept to reserve bus tickets. From this system, user can view bus list, book tickets, check bus status board. While booking tickets, the user can enter the bus name with route/number then the system displays total bus seat number with passengers name and user has to enter the number of tickets, seat number and name of person.  There would be no chance of data misuse or loss. 

**Functionalities are as follows:**
•	Enter bus no/name

•	Departure from

•	Select to city

•	Departure to city

•	Total seats

•	Total available seats

•	Total buses available

•	Enter passenger’s name

•	Number of seats

•	Limit exceed if 

•	Show ticket details


**Proposal:**
We will try to implement the system using the concepts of object oriented programming in c++ within the permitted limits.
